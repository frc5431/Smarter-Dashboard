# Smarter-Dashboard
This is for Team 5431's Driver Station code. It is to replace the Smart Dashboard provided by WPILib.

#This is horrible. I can't customize it!
A brand new version of this is currently being written, with the hope it will be finished for the 2017 season. View progress here:

* [ ] Fast graphical backend 
  * In-progess. View [here](https://github.com/liavt/MACE)
* [ ]  Widget and plugin api, which is fast and easy to implement
  * With support for other languages, like Python or Java
* [ ]  Roborio-to-computer api
* [ ]  Front-end and rendering of widgets
* [ ]  Drag-and-drop style creator
* [ ]  Saving and loading premade dashboards
  * Most likely via XML
* [ ]  Live robot display
